# Flaskr


The basic blog app built in the Flask `tutorial`_.  Forked from the Flaskr blogging platform, an example written with Flask by Armin Ronacher.

.. _tutorial: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/tutorial/

## New Instructions
See `make` for details on building, packaging, etc.  This application builds a Docker image (see `Dockerfile`), which can then be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.  The dpeloyment spec is in `flaskr.yaml`.

| NOTE: The remainder of the instructions are kept from the original.  

## Install

**Be sure to use the same version of the code as the version of the docs
you're reading.** You probably want the latest tagged version, but the
default Git version is the main branch. ::

    # clone the repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/pallets/flask
    $ cd flask
    # checkout the correct version
    $ git tag  # shows the tagged versions
    $ git checkout latest-tag-found-above
    $ cd examples/tutorial

Create a virtualenv and activate it::

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

Or on Windows cmd::

    $ py -3 -m venv venv
    $ venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install Flaskr::

    $ pip install -e .

Or if you are using the main branch, install Flask from source before
installing Flaskr::

    $ pip install -e ../..
    $ pip install -e .
